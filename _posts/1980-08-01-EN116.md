* Page 3 A 39-Channel Variable-Q Filter Bank (Part 2)

This issue gives Part 2 of the 39-channel filter bank report, and thus is in a sense paired with the previous issue, EN#115. Note however that this issue is eight pages long instead of 10, while the next issue, EN#117 is 14 pages long instead of 12. The paired mailing of EN#116 and EN#117 is for mailing purposes - the weight is just right. Issues ENfllS and EN#119 will also be paired for mailing, and will arrive soon.


# News and notes

A new publication in the electronic music area is *Synthersource* from Curtis Electromusic, which is now at 110Highland Ave, Los Gatos, CA 95030.  The first issue, Vol. 1, No. 1, has been issued and deals principally with CEM products, including the new CEM3350 dual state-variable filter and the CEM3360 dua VCA.  Also included is an interview with Tom Oberheim.  While the first issue clearly looks more lik a "house organ" for CEM, this in itself is not bad, since you will find in it detailed technical information on the CEM cips.  Also, there is an indication that guture issues will include inforation from the outside.  Issue 1 is 15 pages long, and *Synthersource* plans to publish four times per year for a subscription cost of $12.50.  Worth looking into.


# Reader's Questions

![Preferred Circuits Collection](/assets/EN116/test_pic.png)


**Q:** In the Preferred Circuits Collection, the sample-and-hold - 2, is a 74COO correct for IC-3, and what are the pin numbers for each connection? I don't understand the top connection to the top NAND gate or the -15 to the bottom gate.

**A:** The short answer to your question is that any CMOS NAND gate can be used here, and the 74COO is a good choice, or you could also use the type 4011. Both of these take their more positive supply level on pin 14, and
their more negative supply on pin 7. The most
common arrangement is +15 on pin 14, and ground
on pin 7, but here we wanted the output to swing
over a range from ground to -15. Thus we use
ground as the most positive voltage (on pin 14)
and -15 for the more negative voltage (on pin 7}
as shown in the figure at the right.
Probably what is confusing is the inclusion
of power supply connections in the first place,
as these are commonly left off schematic diagrams.
Here they are shown because they are not the usual
arrangement. A good analogy might be that in
writing down musical notation, flats and sharps are
put in the key signature, and are understood to be
present throughout the piece, unlejis^ cancelled by
a natural sign for an individual note.
The other thing to keep in mind is that IC's are powered between two voltage
levels, and that it is the magnitude and relative polarity of this difference that
matters, along with an absolute maximum difference that is allowed. For CMOS, the
absolute maximum is 18 volts, so it can't be run between +15 and -15 since this is
a difference of 30 volts (you will blow the chip if you try). Thus common levels
would be +15 and ground, +7.5 and -7.5, or ground and -15, as in the above example.
In particular note that the need to maintain the correct polarity of the supply
voltage means that if you want to change from a zero to -15 swing instead of a zero
to +15 swing, you do not put -15 on the pin where you formerly had +15 and leave
ground the same, but rather you must change both the regular power supply pin and
ground.
